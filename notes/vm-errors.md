## 🛑 Error: VirtualBox VM Fails to Start with VBoxHardening or USB Proxy Errors

### Error Details:
When starting the VM, the following error appeared:

```

Failed to enumerate host USB devices.
Could not load the Host USB Proxy Service (VERR\_FILE\_NOT\_FOUND).
Result Code: E\_FAIL (0x80004005)
Component: HostWrap
Interface: IHost

```

Also, in the log file (`VBoxHardening.log`), errors like these were present:

```

Error opening VBoxDrvStub: STATUS\_OBJECT\_NAME\_NOT\_FOUND
supR3HardenedWinReadErrorInfoDevice: NtCreateFile -> 0xc0000034
Error -101 in supR3HardenedWinReSpawn! (enmWhat=3)
NtCreateFile(\Device\VBoxDrvStub) failed: 0xc0000034 STATUS\_OBJECT\_NAME\_NOT\_FOUND

````

### Cause:
This is usually caused by a **conflict with Windows security features**, missing or corrupted VirtualBox drivers, or antivirus interference blocking VirtualBox services.

### Fix and Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Run VirtualBox as Administrator**  
   Sometimes permissions prevent the proper loading of drivers.

2. **Reinstall VirtualBox with “Run as Administrator”**  
   Uninstall VirtualBox, then download the latest version and install it again **right-click > Run as administrator** to ensure drivers are properly installed.

3. **Disable or Configure Antivirus/Windows Defender**  
   Security software can block VirtualBox driver operations.  
   - Add VirtualBox and its drivers to antivirus exceptions.  
   - Temporarily disable antivirus to test.

4. **Check USB Settings**  
   The error can come from USB device enumeration issues.  
   - In VM settings, try **unchecking USB controller** to start VM.  
   - If unchecking fails (auto-rechecks), you may need to fix driver installation or reinstall VirtualBox.

5. **Ensure Hyper-V is Disabled**  
   VirtualBox conflicts with Hyper-V on Windows.  
   - Disable Hyper-V via Control Panel or PowerShell:  
     ```powershell
     dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V
     ```  
   - Reboot after disabling.

6. **Check Windows Updates**  
   Certain Windows updates can affect VirtualBox. Ensure your Windows version is compatible.

### Additional Notes:

- No screenshot was captured for this error due to the nature of the message appearing outside the VM interface.
- Detailed logs are available in the VM’s log folder for deeper troubleshooting (`VBoxHardening.log`).
- This error is common on Windows hosts; troubleshooting steps usually resolve it.
